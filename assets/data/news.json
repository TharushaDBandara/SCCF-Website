    "content": "Project Nethra — aptly meaning “eyes” — is a visionary community service project jointly organized by the Interact Clubs of St. Sylvester’s College and Girls’ High School Kandy, with the Social Contribution Collective Foundation (SCCF) serving as a proud supportive partner.\r\n\r\nHeld on November 5th at Sahas Uyana, Kandy, the initiative was designed to create a lasting impact on visual health and eye donation awareness throughout the island. Through free eye checkups, distribution of spectacles, and facilitation of eye donation pledges, Project Nethra embodies the true spirit of humanitarian service and empathy.\r\n\r\nSCCF’s partnership played a pivotal role in empowering this movement — helping expand outreach, streamline logistics, and foster collaboration among volunteers, medical professionals, and community members. Together with other partners such as Manusath Derana, Akshidana Eye Donation Society, and Red Cross Sri Lanka, the project successfully delivered over 1,000 free eye checkups, provided 300 spectacles, and encouraged 500+ eye donation pledges.\r\n\r\nBy supporting initiatives like Project Nethra, SCCF continues its mission of illuminating lives, one vision at a time — inspiring collective compassion and sustainable change within Sri Lanka’s communities.",
