## Dynamic Image System

The website includes an automatic image shuffling system that:

‚ú® **Auto-rotates images** every 30 seconds
üîÑ **Randomly selects** from available images in each folder
üöÄ **Graceful fallbacks** to placeholder images if files are missing
üì± **Responsive design** adapts to all screen sizes
‚ö° **Performance optimized** with lazy loading

## Adding New Images

1. **Choose the appropriate folder** based on image content
2. **Follow naming conventions**:
   - Use descriptive, lowercase names
   - Separate words with hyphens
   - Include year if relevant
   - Example: `community-meeting-2024.jpg`

3. **Optimize images before upload**:
   - Compress to reduce file size (aim for under 500KB)
   - Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics
   - Ensure proper dimensions for best display

4. **Update the image arrays** in `main.js` if you want specific images to show first

## Technical Implementation

The dynamic system is handled by the `HeroImageManager` class in `assets/main.js`:

```javascript
// Add images to a specific category
window.addImagesToCategory('community-development', [
  'assets/images/community-development/new-image.jpg'
]);

// Manually trigger shuffle
window.manualShuffle();

// Change shuffle interval (in seconds)
window.setShuffleInterval(60); // 60 seconds
```
